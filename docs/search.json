    "text": "Hello, my name is Freya Olsson, a postdoctoral researcher at Virginia Tech. I am passionate about understanding broadscale ecosystem functioning and abiotic-biotic interactions through the integration of process-based modelling and field measurements to better manage ecosystems, especially lakes and reservoirs.\nIn my current role I am leveraging modelling frameworks and sensor networks to develop short-term and long-term forecasts of freshwater habitats.\nI work with range of statistical and process-based models to forecast conditions in freshwater sites across the continental US and champion the aquatics EFI-NEON Forecast Challenge that uses these data."
