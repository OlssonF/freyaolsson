My research interests are broadly in understanding the interactions between abiotic factors and ecosystem functioning, especially of lakes and reservoirs. I am interested in how we can use process-based modelling and large-scale field data to better understand the functioning of these systems and better improve their management now and in the future.

Some of my main interests are:

-   interaction of lake physics on chemistry and biology
-   impact of inflows on lakes
-   integrating data and models to improve understanding
-   near-term lake forecasting
