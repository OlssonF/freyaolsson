I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Virginia Tech, working with Dr Quinn Thomas and Dr Cayelan Carey. In my current role, I am leveraging modelling frameworks and sensor networks to develop near-term forecasts of freshwater habitats. I work with range of statistical and process-based models to forecast conditions in freshwater sites across the continental US and champion the aquatics EFI-NEON Forecast Challenge that uses these data. Read more about the project [here](https://www.ecoforecastprojectvt.org/).

I completed my PhD in Environmental Science in January 2022 at the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology and Lancaster University, UK. I am passionate about understanding broad-scale ecosystem functioning and abiotic-biotic interactions through the integration of process-based modelling and field measurements to better manage ecosystems, especially lakes and reservoirs.
