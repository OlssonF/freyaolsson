I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Environmental Science at Radboud University, Netherlands working with Dr Aafke Schipper. As part of the Water4All PLURALAKES project, we are working to see how stakeholder visions can be incorporated into desired future scenarios for lakes and determine practicable and sustainable strategies to achieve these future scenarios.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Virginia Tech Center for Ecosystem Forecasting](https://ecoforecast.centers.vt.edu/), USA, working with Dr Quinn Thomas and Dr Cayelan Carey. In this role, I leveraged forecasting and modelling frameworks to develop near-term forecasts of freshwater habitats. I worked with range of process-based and empirical models to forecast conditions in freshwater sites across in the US and Australia and championed the aquatics [EFI-NEON Forecast Challenge](https://projects.ecoforecast.org/neon4cast-ci/) that uses these data.

I completed my PhD in Environmental Science in January 2022 at the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology and Lancaster University, UK. I am passionate about understanding broad-scale ecosystem functioning and abiotic-biotic interactions through the integration of process-based modelling and field measurements to better manage ecosystems, especially lakes and reservoirs.
